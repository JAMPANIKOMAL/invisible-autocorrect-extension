# Invisible Autocorrect - Chrome Extension

## About The Project

Invisible Autocorrect is a Chrome extension that brings seamless, phone-like autocorrect to your browser. Unlike traditional spell checkers that underline errors and require manual correction, this extension instantly and invisibly fixes thousands of common typing mistakes as soon as you press the spacebar.

The correction engine uses an AI model to intelligently predict intended words from typos, leveraging a comprehensive analysis of the English language.
